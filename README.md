# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To assist Louise with her theater project campaign, we aim to analyze campaign performance in relation to their launch  dates and their funding goals. We plan to influence Louise’s campaign decisions by providing visualizations which demonstrate when is the best time to launch a campaign and how much the goal should be to achieve optimal success. 
## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
In order to determine when theater kickstarter campaigns were most successful, we first created a pivot table using our kickstarter data to display the month the campaign was launched and the quantity of kickstarters which were deemed successful, failed or canceled. We then used our pivot table to create a pivot chart to display our data in the form of a line graph. Successful theater campaigns were tracked on the blue line, failed campaigns were on the orange line and canceled campaigns were on the grey line. The number of kickstarters was on our y-axis and the months of the year on the x-axis. Through the analysis of our pivot chart we can deduce that theater kickstarter campaigns are most successful in the months of May & June and least successful (failed the most) in the month of October. In terms of canceled campaigns, they represent only 3% of the total number of campaigns so they have little significance in relation to the rest of our data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our secondary analysis was aimed to help Louise determine what her kickstarter goals should be in order to have a successful campaign. To analyze the success of theater campaigns based on their goals, we established 12 dollar-amount ranges in which the campaigns could be grouped on. We then used the countif function to quantify the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the goal ranges. After summing the total amount of projects per dollar-amount range, we were then able to determine the percent of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the different goals. The line graph below represents the campaign outcomes based on their goals, with percent successful on the blue line, percent failed on the orange line and percent canceled on the grey line. The percentage of kickstarters was on our y-axis and the goal amount ranges were on the x-axis. Through the analysis of our line graph we can determine that generally the higher the goal amount the less likely the kickstarter was successful. The percentage of successful campaigns steadily decreased as the goal amounts increased and began to increase at the $25000 - $29999 range. Successful campaigns then experience a sharp decline after the $40000 - $44999 goal range. The percentage of failed campaigns steadily increased as the goal amounts increased and decreased at the points where the successful campaigns began to increase. Canceled theater projects represented 0% of the total theater projects analyzed.

### Challenges and Difficulites Encountered 
Some challenges and difficulties encountered during our analysis were related to filtering our data accurately to represent the sample of the population that Louise was inquiring about. When determining the theater outcomes based on launch date it was imperative that our pivot table was displaying the months of the year vs the actual year the campaign was launched. When determining the outcomes based on goals I learned that the countif function applies a “filter” embedded within the formula. I initially filtered the data on the kickstarter tab on outcome and then realized that the formula would already provide you with the outcome by putting the outcome you want in quotation marks and highlighting the columns the data would be found in. 
## Results 
- The conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes based on Launch Date analysis are 1) that the most successful months to launch a theater kickstarter campaign are in May and June and 2) the least successful month to launch a theater kickstarter campaign is in October. 

- The conclusion that can be drawn from the Outcomes based on Goals analysis is that generally as the goal amount increased the percentage of successful kickstarters decreased. 

- Some limitations of this dataset are that our analysis was not filtered by country so our outcomes are a conglomerate of multiple countries data on theater kickstarter campaigns. If Louise wanted to get a better understanding of when to launch a campaign and what goals to set we would want to filter on the country she plans to launch the kickstarter in. Secondly, if Lousie plans to launch a kickstarter campaign in a country outside of the United States she would have to convert the goal amount from USD to the currency used in that country.  

- Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create would be an additional line graph on theater outcomes based on launch  date but filtered on the specific country that Louise is interested in launching her campaign. If Louise was unsure of the country she wanted to launch a successful campaign then I would recommend using a stacked column bar graph so that each country that provided kickstarter data was represented so we can see what country yielded the most successful campaigns at any given month. Lastly, a pie chart could be a good visual to represent the total percent successful, failed and canceled kickstarters.
