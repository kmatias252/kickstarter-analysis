# Kickstaring with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To assist Louise with her theater project campaign, we aim to analyze campaign performance in relation to their launch  dates and their funding goals. We plan to influence Louiseâ€™s campaign decisions by providing visualizations which demonstrate when is the best time to launch a campaign and how much the goal should be to achieve optimal success. 
## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
In order to determine when theater kickstarter campaigns were most successful, we first created a pivot table using our kickstarter data to display the month the campaign was launched and the quantity of kickstarters which were deemed successful, failed or canceled. We then used our pivot table to create a pivot chart to display our data in the form of a line graph. Successful theater campaigns were tracked on the blue line, failed campaigns were on the orange line and canceled campaigns were on the grey line. The number of kickstarters was on our y-axis and the months of the year on the x-axis. Through the analysis of our pivot chart we can deduce that theater kickstarter campaigns are most successful in the months of May & June and least successful (failed the most) in the month of October. In terms of canceled campaigns, they represent only 3% of the total number of campaigns so they have little significance in relation to the rest of our data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our secondary analysis was aimed to help Louise determine what her kickstarter goals should be in order to have a successful campaign. To analyze the success of theater campaigns based on their goals, we established 12 dollar-amount ranges in which the campaigns could be grouped on. We then used the countif function to quantify the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the goal ranges. After summing the total amount of projects per dollar-amount range, we were then able to determine the percent of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the different goals. The line graph below represents the campaign outcomes based on their goals, with percent successful on the blue line, percent failed on the orange line and percent canceled on the grey line. The percentage of kickstarters was on our y-axis and the goal amount ranges were on the x-axis. Through the analysis of our line graph we can determine that generally the higher the goal amount the less successful the kickstarter campaign was. The percentage of successful campaigns steadily decreased as the goal amounts increased and began to increase at the $25000 - $29999 range. Successful campaigns then experience a sharp decline after the $40000 - $44999 goal range. The percentage of failed campaigns steadily increased as the goal amounts increased and decreased at the points where the successful campaigns began to increase. Canceled theater projects represented 0% of the total theater projects analyzed.

### Challenges and Difficulites Encountered 

## Results 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
