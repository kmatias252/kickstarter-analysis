# Kickstaring with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To assist Louise with her theater project campaign, we aim to analyze campaign performance in relation to their launch  dates and their funding goals. We plan to influence Louiseâ€™s campaign decisions by providing visualizations which demonstrate when is the best time to launch a campaign and how much the goal should be to achieve optimal success.
